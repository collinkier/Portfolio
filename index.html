            <p id="intro">My name is Collin Kier. I am currently a student at the UCSD extension program and I am 
                learning how to code. I grew up in Washington state and moved to california about 3 years ago.
                My favorite things to do include basically anything to do with the outdoors. I love to hunt,
                fish, camp, ride horses, and just about anything you can imagine if it involves getting outside.
                My favorite color is green, since there was so much of it where I grew up in Washington. Walk outide and all 
                that is visible is thick vegetation and foliage. Beatiful forests up there. One of my hopes with coding is to
                be able to move back there sometime soon and hopefully get a job in Seattle. But we will see. Fingers crossed.
